\caption{\label{fig:reg}A-B. Observed effects (\(d_i\), dashed line) and model-based estimates (\(\theta_i\), solid line) for Rey Mermet et al.'s (2018) Stroop and flanker tasks. The shaded area shows the 95\% credible interval for model-based effects. The signal-to-noise ratio \(\gamma\) is low indicating considerable trial noise. C. Posterior distribution of model-based correlation (\(\rho\)) between Stroop and flanker effects. The dashed lines denote the 95\% credible interval. The point and segments above the distribution show the observed corrlelation coefficient and associated 95\% CI. D-E. Analogous plots for the Mueller-Lyer and Poggendorf illusions F. Anaologous plot for the correlation between Mueller-Lyer and Poggendorf effects.}
