Sample estimates of $\gamma$ are, respectively, `r round(stroopGamma$obsGamma,3)`, and `r round(flankGamma$obsGamm,3)` for the Stroop and flanker tasks, and, respectively, `r round(mlGamma$obsGamma,3)`, and `r round(pogGamma$obsGamm,3)`, for the Mueller-Lyar and Poggendorf illusions.  These values are very close to the model-based ones in Figure \ref{fig:reg}.The main advantages of Bayesian-model estimators in comparison are two-fold.  First, resulting estimates are always in the valid range (between -1 and 1 for correlation; positive for $\gamma^2$).  Second, estimates of correlation and signal-to-noise ratios come with uncertainties such as those in Figure \ref{fig:reg}.There is a potential issue with sample estimates.  There is no guarantee that $\hat{\gamma}^2$ is positive.  The situation is analogous to that with Spearman's disattenuation formula.  In Spearman's case, the disattenuated correlations were not guaranteed to be real numbers, and even when they were, they were not guaranteed to be in the [-1,1] interval. In our case, negative values of $\hat{\gamma}^2$ means that the task is very unreliable and more trials and people are needed to establish this low value.^[The model is $Y_{ik\ell} \sim \mbox{N}(\alpha_i+x_k\theta_i,\sigma^2)$ where both $\alpha_i$ (speed) and $\theta_i$ (effect) are treated as random effects: $\alpha_i \sim \mbox{N}(\nu_\alpha,\gamma^2_\alpha\sigma^2)$ and $\theta_i \sim \mbox{N}(\nu_\theta,\gamma^2_\theta\sigma^2)$.  Posterior means of $\gamma_\theta$ and $\gamma_\alpha$ are shown in Table~\ref{tab:allTasks} for rows labeled *Effect* and *Speed*, respectively.]
