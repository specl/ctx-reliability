suppose
\(I\)
people
each
run
\(L\)
trials
in
congruent

conditions.
Let
\(i\)
denote
people,
\(k\)
denote
conditions,
and
\(\ell
\)
denote
replicate

Observations,
denoted
\(Y_{ik\ell

are
modeled
as
\(Y_{ik\ell

=

where
\(x_k\)
contrast
codes
condition
and
is
-1/2
and
1/2
for
congruent
and
incongruent
conditions
respectively.
Parameter
\(\alpha
_i\)
is
the
true
overall
score
for
the
\(i\)th
participant.
Parameter
\(\theta
_i\)
is
the
true
difference
between
incongruent
and
congruent
conditions---it
is
the
\(i\)th
participant's
true
effect
and
the
main
target
of
analysis.
The
error
term
is
\(\epsilon
_{ik\ell
}
\sim
\mbox
{Normal}(0,\sigma
^2_W)\),
with
\(\sigma
^2_W\)
describing
the
variability
of
trial
noise.
True
effect
\(\theta
_i\)
is
random:
\(\theta
_i
\sim
\mbox
{Normal}(\nu
,\sigma
^2_B)\),
where
\(\nu
\)
and
\(\sigma
_B^2\)
describe
the

mean
and

macro:->Eq.
(\ref

for
tasks
with

such
as
the
Stroop
task.
For

without

the

macro:->Derivation
is
as
follows:
Note
that
\(d_i\sim
\mbox
{Normal}(\nu
,2\sigma
^2/L+\delta
^2)\).
Hence,
sample
variance
has
an
expectation
of
\(\mbox
{E}[\mbox
{Var}(d)]=2\sigma
^2/L+\delta
^2\).
Substituting
in
\(\gamma
^2\)
yields,
\(\mbox
{E}[\mbox
{Var}(d)]=\sigma
^2(2/L+\gamma
^2)\).
Rearranging
yields
the
estimator
in
(\ref
{sampGammaTask})
with
\(\mbox
{Var}(d)=\sum
_i
(d_i-\bar
{d})^2/(I-1)\),
and
\(\hat
{\sigma
}^2=\mbox
{MSE}=\sum
_{ik\ell
}
(Y_{ik\ell
}-\bar
{Y}_{ik})^2/(2I(L-1))\).
For
tasks
without
contrasts,
the
analogous
formula
is
\(\hat
{\gamma
}^2
=
\frac
{\mbox
{Var}(d)}{\hat
{\sigma
}^2}-\frac
{1}{L}.\)
